All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick-start
Me and my broken heart

I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick-start
Me and my broken heart

Shotgun,
Aimed at my heart,
You got one
Tear me apart
And then some
How do we call this love (whoa, oh oh oh)

I try
To run away but your eyes
Tell me to stay, oh why,
Why do we call this love (whoa, oh oh oh)

It seems like we've been losing control
